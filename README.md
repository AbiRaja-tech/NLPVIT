Requirements
------------

* python==3.8.8
* pytorch==1.9.0
* transformers==4.6.1
* nltk==3.6.2

Downloading Datasets
------------

You need to download the following datasets:

 * [WSD Evaluation Framework](http://lcl.uniroma1.it/wsdeval)
 * [UFSAC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oigo3kzRosz2VjyA44vpJZ58tDFyLRMO)
 * [FEWS](https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/fews/)

Setting up variables
------------

You need to modify `script/config.sh` according to your environment.
Set `data` variable to the top directory where all the datasets are stored.

Processing FEWS
------------

```
bash experiment/fews/run.sh
```

Using trained models
------------

You can train the models from scratch.
Alternatively, you can use our [trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YO_tyE7Cm7uXqXaYnfNzdNhhEavb_mz7/view?usp=sharing).
